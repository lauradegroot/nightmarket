Designers
- Ay Bee See Stop links to the nightmarket page
- Brother's dressler links to the event page as well
- AGO doing the same
- so is Book
- and Boyashi Design
- and THE COOP
- as well as Encounters of Humankind, Fricassee Collective, G.I.D., Gensler, Ingrain, J3SM, Markup, ninety3/4, one:one, PHurson (this is find particularly hilarious. It sounds like Person), Salt & Light, Lockwood & Mullings, T2+A+I+L, TANK, Teem 11, Teeple Architects, Agents of Urban Change
- I realized halfway through this that this was probably intentional because you dont have their websites. If so, just remove the links for these guys entirely. And we'll add links as they come in
- there are two Dialogue38s
- can you put Agents of Urban Change, and Bare Minimum in alphabetical order?

Sponsors
- the sponsors need to have their levels acknowledged (you can refer to the text document I sent you for that stuff)
- these headings are hierarchical, so if you could make each sponsor level's size consistent to visually represent a hierarchy, that'd be great!
- (ie. In-kind sponsors logos would be smallest)



Top menu bar
- when I click on "The Stop's Night Market" i'd like it to jump back up to the top of the page

Scroll
- I think i'm seeing the funny scroll thing that's happening
- is it happening over "About the stop's night market" section? it moves over it super quick, like, almost jumps!
